FeinCMS 1.12 release notes
==========================

Welcome to FeinCMS 1.12!

.. warning::

   This is a cleanup release. Lots of changes ahead!


Simplification of import paths
==============================


Template content requires explicit list of templates
====================================================

The template refactor in Django removed the ability to enumerate
templates in template folders. Because of that templates must now
be explicitly specified when creating the content type::

    Page.create_content_type(TemplateContent, TEMPLATES=[
        ('content/template/something1.html', 'something'),
        ('content/template/something2.html', 'something else'),
        ('base.html', 'makes no sense'),
    ])

Also, you need to add a model migration which renames the old
``filename`` field to the new ``template`` field::

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    from __future__ import unicode_literals

    from django.db import models, migrations


    class Migration(migrations.Migration):

        dependencies = [
            ('page', 'WHATEVER IS APPROPRIATE'),
        ]

        operations = [
            migrations.RenameField('TemplateContent', 'filename', 'template'),
        ]


The blog module has been completely removed
============================================


Caching of pages in various page manager methods has been removed
=================================================================


Backwards-incompatible changes
==============================

* FeinCMS requires Django 1.7 or better.

* Django has removed comments support a long time ago, which meant
  that our bundled comments content in ``feincms.content.comments``
  was broken for some time. It has been completely removed.

* ``feincms.content.rss`` has been removed, use ``feincms-syndication``
  instead.


Removal of deprecated features
------------------------------

South is not supported anymore? Django 1.7 and better only?

``feincms.views.cbv`` has been removed. Use ``feincms.urls`` and
``feincms.views`` directly instead.


New deprecations
================

* VideoContent, SectionContent, ContactForm?, old import paths
* Point 1


Notable features and improvements
=================================

* Rich text cleaning using Tidy has been removed.

* ``FEINCMS_JQUERY_NO_CONFLICT`` is gone. Either use ``django.jQuery`` or
  ``feincms.jQuery`` explicitly.

* Some support has been added for ``django-filer``.

Bugfixes
========

* Bug fix 1


Compatibility with Django and other apps
========================================

FeinCMS 1.12 requires Django 1.7 or better.
